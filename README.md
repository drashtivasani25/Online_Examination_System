The Online Examination System is a web-based application built using ASP.NET Web Forms that allows administrators to manage subjects and teachers to add multiple-choice questions for student assessments. The admin panel enables administrators to add, and manage subjects, while the teacher panel allows teachers to select subjects and add questions with multiple options displayed using radio buttons, storing the correct answer for automatic evaluation. Students can select subjects, take exams, and submit their responses through a user-friendly interface. The system processes and stores user responses, calculates scores, and displays results automatically. It is developed using ASP.NET Web Forms with C#, SQL Server for database management, and custom-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend without using Bootstrap.
